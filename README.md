# breast-calculator
Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) remains debating for breast cancer patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic nomogram to predict the likelihood of long-term survival with and without PMRT in order to optimize the individual locoregional control strategy for this particular cohort. Age, tumor size, grade, estrogen/progestogen receptor status, and number of involved nodes were incorporated into the nomogram and the constructed nomogram demonstrated good accuracy in predicting 5- and 10-year survival. When using this website calculator, physicians need to choose on each variable listed on the calculator and the survival rate with or without PMRT can be obtained. This clinically validated nomogram provided a useful tool to predict 5- and 10-year DSS and OS for patients with one to three positive nodes and can aid tailored clinical decision making by estimating predicted benefit from PMRT.
